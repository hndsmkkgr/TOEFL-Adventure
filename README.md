# TOEFL-Adventure
Tugas Akhir / Skripsi. TOEFL Adventures (2021) Game app
<p>This is a game I made for my bachelor degree's thesis, it is quite old and there are tons of things I would love to improve but haven't got the time to. The files are quite messy because of that. So, here is a quick step by step on how to download and use the program, hopefully it makes up for my messy file management :D</p>

<h3>How to Download and Use:</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>download project from github.</li>
<li>extract TOEFL Adventures_Data.rar into the same folder as the project.</li>
<li>check MANUAL.pdf and follow the instructions on page 1, number 3 & 4.</li>
<li>To use and to customize game contents, read the manual from page 2.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disclaimer: this is a nonprofit game, for educational purposes. The sounds, TOEFL questions, study materials, etc are used only as examples and I do not take credit for them other than the game and art itself.
